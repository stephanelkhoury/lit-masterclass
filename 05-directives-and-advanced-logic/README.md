# Module 5: Directives and Advanced Logic

In this module, you'll learn about Lit's powerful directives system for extending templates with custom logic.

## What You'll Learn

- Using built-in directives
- Creating custom directives
- Advanced template control flow
- Performance optimization techniques
- State management approaches

## Topics Covered

1. **Built-in Directives**
   - `repeat` for efficient list rendering
   - `cache` for conditional sub-templates
   - `classMap` and `styleMap` for dynamic styling
   - `ref` for DOM references

2. **Custom Directives**
   - Directive creation API
   - Building reusable template logic
   - Stateful directives
   - Asynchronous directives

3. **Advanced Control Flow**
   - Complex conditional rendering
   - Nested loops and conditionals
   - Performance considerations

4. **State Management**
   - Stores and observables
   - External state integration
   - Avoiding common pitfalls

## Project

You'll build a data dashboard with complex UI logic, filtering, and visualization that showcases advanced directives usage.
